# Pong Game

A basic pong game created by using SVG shapes and Javascript logics. The game runs by continuously rendering a "moving" ball and paddles. The ball will then detect if it will collide with a wall or a paddle using Javascript collision function. If the ball reaches the horizontal ends of the game, a player will score. First player to hit 15 points wins the game, with a little catch of everytime a player scores, their paddle will slightly grow in height.
